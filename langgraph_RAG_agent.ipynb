            "In 2024, the Russell 2000, which is a benchmark for small-cap stocks, experienced a more modest performance compared to larger indices. It rose about 10-11% for the year. This performance was in contrast to the broader market, where indices like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite saw much higher gains, with the S&P 500 delivering a roughly 25% total return and the Nasdaq Composite jumping nearly 29% for the year. The disparity highlighted that the rally in 2024 was not evenly distributed across the market, with mega-cap technology stocks dominating the gains. (Source: Document 1)\n",
